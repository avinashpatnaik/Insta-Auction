# Insta-Auction
InstaAuction, an application developed in iOS is essentially a guide to the ACV Vehicle Condition Inspector(VCI) helping him/her to get a gist of the 360° imagery of the car. The application uses latest technologies like Depth Sensing, Machine Learning, Image Detection, Stabilization to achieve normalized distance walkaround. It involves the Vehicle Inspector moving around the car capturing the best possible frames by following the instructions provided by the application. The application is smart enough to sense the car, detect the side of the car, how fast the user is moving around the car and how far he/she is away from the car. It combines all the technologies, stabilises the recorded video and generates a 360° imagery low frame rate video.  
 
 The above can be seen in action at the following link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvD4307a94  
 
 All the technical documentation/research/findings can be found in the pdf named - Techincal Documentation.pdf 
 
 The code for the custom model which detects the side of the car can be found in the file named -  ACV_CarSideDetection.ipynb
 
 The code for stablising the video and converting into the 360 degree imagery can be found in the file named - stab_360.py
